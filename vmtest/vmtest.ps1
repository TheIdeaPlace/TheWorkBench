.SYNOPSIS
Test a Windows app inside a Hyper-V test VM (ClaudeTesting, or a copy of it) instead of on this PC.

.DESCRIPTION
A task (a repo and branch) takes a free VM from the pool with 'begin', works in it, and either
'save's it (keep the state for next time) or 'end's it (after merge: back to Clean). Repo and branch
come from the current git folder unless -Repo and -Branch are given. Every command that works inside
a VM uses the one this task holds.

  prepare [-Force] [-VM name]      one time: automatic sign-in, agent, Clean checkpoint
  prepare -Pool [-Force]           make the pool's other VMs from the first VM's Clean
  status                           each VM: its state, who has it, checkpoints
  begin [-VM name] [-Wait] [-Force]
                                   take a free VM; carry on, restore this task's checkpoint, or start
                                   from Clean. -Wait waits up to -Timeout seconds when all are busy.
  deploy <path> [-Name n]          copy a build folder or file to C:\vmtest\apps\<name>
  push <file> [-Destination dir]   copy a file into the VM (default C:\vmtest\files)
  launch <exe> [-Arguments "a b"]  start a program in the VM (path inside the VM)
  windows                          list open windows and what has focus
  tree [-Window w] [-Depth n]      UI Automation tree of a window (default: the one in front)
  focused                          the control with keyboard focus
  invoke <control> [-Window w]     press, toggle, select or expand a control (AutomationId or name)
  setvalue <control> <value>       set a text box's value
  focus <control> [-Window w]      move keyboard focus to a control
  keys <keys> [-Window w]          send keys, SendKeys syntax: {TAB} {ENTER} ^s %f +{TAB}
  type <text> [-Window w]          type plain text (text starting with - goes in -Target)
  run <command> [-Timeout s]       run a command line as the signed-in user; default 600 s, at most 3600.
                                   Batch-file rules apply: write % as %%.
  run -ScriptFile <file>           copy a .cmd/.bat/.ps1 from this PC and run it the same way
                                   (anything it leaves running may end with it; use launch for that)
  close [-Window w]                close a window, and say whether it really closed
  shot <out.png> [-FromHost]       picture of the VM's screen
  save                             checkpoint this task, park the VM, release it
  end [-Force -VM name]            after merge: delete this task's checkpoints, its VM back to Clean
  host <computer>                  one time: use the test VMs on another PC; checks it, saves your
                                   sign-in for it and copies vmtest there

-Window is a process id (its main window) or part of a window title (dialogs included).
<control> is an AutomationId or a name; id:<id> matches only an AutomationId (id:-31984 for a
negative one) and name:<name> only a name.
-Elevated runs launch, run and the UI commands with admin rights. Without it, programs run like a
normal user's would; use it for per-machine installs and to drive windows of elevated programs.
'vmtest run' exits with the command's own exit code.

With VMTEST_HOST set to a computer's name, every command but 'host' runs on that PC's test VMs over
PowerShell remoting. Files named here are copied there, and pictures are copied back.
