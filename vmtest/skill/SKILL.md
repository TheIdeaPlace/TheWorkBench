name: vmtest
description: Test a Windows desktop app inside a Hyper-V test VM instead of on the user's own PC, so the user's focus, keyboard and screen reader are never disturbed. Use whenever testing would open a window, even for a moment, send keys or clicks, read an app's accessibility tree, take a screenshot of an app, or install or uninstall software (MSI, winget, setup.exe) for a Windows app. That includes automated test suites (pytest, xUnit and so on) in which any test builds a GUI window. Only builds and tests that never create a window stay on the PC. Not needed for web pages, or for iOS or Mac apps.

# Testing Windows apps in the test VM (vmtest)

Never launch, click, type into or install a Windows app on the user's own PC to test it. The user
is working on that PC, perhaps with a screen reader, and test windows steal focus, take keystrokes
and get read aloud. Do all of that in the VM with vmtest. Only builds and tests that never create a
window stay on the PC.

**"Unit tests" don't get a pass.** A test suite counts as opening a window if any test in it builds a
GUI window (wx, WinForms, WPF, WinUI, Qt, Tk), even for a moment, even hidden, even if it's called a
unit test. Many check focus, so they Show, Raise and SetFocus on purpose, and parallel runners
(`pytest -n 4`) do it several at a time. Before running a suite on the PC, check it: search the
tests for the GUI toolkit's imports (`import wx`, `System.Windows`, `QApplication`, `tkinter`). See
"Running a repo's tests in the VM" below.

## Finding vmtest

The `VMTEST_HOME` environment variable names the folder that holds `vmtest.ps1` and its README.
If it isn't set, ask the user where vmtest is, and suggest they set it once:
`setx VMTEST_HOME "<the vmtest folder>"`.

Run vmtest from the repo you're working in. The task is named after that repo and branch, and
every command works on the test VM your task holds.

```
powershell -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:VMTEST_HOME\vmtest.ps1" <command> [args]
```

**The VMs may be on another PC.** When `VMTEST_HOST` is set, vmtest runs every command on that
PC's test VMs over the network. Nothing changes for you: the commands, paths on this PC, output and
exit codes are the same, and files and pictures are copied across for you. Messages may name that
PC instead of "this PC". If one says there's no saved sign-in for it, give the user the command line
it names to run in their own PowerShell window (it asks for a password, so you can't run it).

**Run every command from that same folder.** Between commands, the shell can go back to the
folder the session started in, and vmtest run from another repo or branch is a different task: it
holds no VM, or takes a second one. So `cd` into the repo in the same command as vmtest every time
(`cd C:\path\to\repo; powershell ... vmtest.ps1 windows`), or pass `-Repo` and `-Branch` on every
command. The same goes for tools built on vmtest. If a command says your task doesn't hold a test
VM and names one "this session holds", you ran it from the wrong folder; nothing is lost.

If `begin` says there's no test VM, or no Clean checkpoint, the one-time setup in vmtest's README
hasn't been done. Tell the user rather than testing on their PC.

## Sharing the VMs with other sessions

Several sessions share a small pool of VMs. Each VM belongs to one task at a time, and vmtest
records which Claude session took it.

- **Never take a VM another session holds.** Don't use `-Force` on `begin` or `end`, delete lock
  files, or run `end -VM` on a VM you don't hold, unless the user tells you to. Each of those
  throws away the other session's unsaved work, and that session finds its VM gone.
- **One session per branch.** Two sessions on the same repo and branch are the same task. While the
  first session is open, vmtest keeps the second off its VM. If you're the second, work on your own
  branch or worktree, or wait with `begin -Wait`; if that times out, ask the user.
- **One VM per session.** `begin` won't give a session a second VM for another task; that's nearly
  always the wrong folder. To move on to another task, `save` or `end` the first one from its folder.
- **Give the VM back when you stop using it.** `save` when you go off to other work for a while or
  wait on the user; `end` once the work has merged. A VM left idle is saved for its task and handed
  to a waiting one: after two hours once its session has closed, after eight while it's still open.
- **If your VM is gone, read the message.** It says whether the VM was saved for you after sitting
  idle (nothing lost: `begin` carries on from the save), was taken with `-Force` (unsaved state
  lost: tell the user which task took it), or whether you ran from the wrong folder. Don't just
  tell the user the VM disappeared, and don't take another session's VM to make up for it.

## The flow

The VM is disposable. Install, break or reconfigure anything in it: `begin` starts from this task's
last checkpoint or Clean, and `end` throws it all away. It is on the user's network, though, so that
freedom stops at the VM itself.

1. `begin` takes a free VM from the pool, and says which one.
   - If every VM is busy, it says who holds each one. Don't keep checking back: run
     `begin -Wait -Timeout 3600` in the background, which takes the first VM that frees up. Don't
     use `-Force` unless the user says so.
   - A task that has left its VM unused for two hours (eight while its session is still open) is
     saved for it and its VM handed on, so a wait never lasts forever.
   - If another open session on this repo and branch has the VM, `begin` says so. See "Sharing the
     VMs with other sessions".
   - It carries on from this task's last state, or starts from Clean. If it says this task's
     checkpoint is on a busy VM and it started from Clean, put back what you need, or wait for that
     VM with `begin -VM <name> -Wait`.
2. Put the build in with one of these:
   - `deploy <build folder> -Name MyApp`, which goes to `C:\vmtest\apps\MyApp`;
   - `push <file>`, which goes to `C:\vmtest\files`.
3. Start it with `launch C:\vmtest\apps\MyApp\MyApp.exe [-Arguments "..."]`. Use `run` for installers and other commands that finish:
   - `run "msiexec /i C:\vmtest\files\x.msi /qn" -Timeout 600`
   - `run "winget install --id X -e --silent --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements"`
4. Look and act. `-Window` is part of a window title, or a process id.
   - `windows` lists open windows, with dialogs indented under the window that owns them, any open menu, and what has focus.
   - `tree -Window MyApp -Depth 8` shows names, AutomationIds, values, states and help text.
   - `keys "{TAB}" -Window MyApp` sends SendKeys syntax: `{ENTER} {ESC} ^s %f +{TAB}`. `+` is Shift, so a literal plus is `{+}`.
   - `type "text" -Window MyApp` types plain text.
   - `invoke <AutomationId or name> -Window MyApp`, `setvalue <control> "<value>"`, `focus <control>`. Write `id:<id>` to match only an AutomationId, or `name:<name>` to match only a name.
   - `focused` shows the control with keyboard focus. Every action also reports where focus landed.
   - `shot C:\path\shot.png` saves a picture of the VM's screen, which you can Read to look at.
   - `close -Window MyApp` closes a window and says whether it really closed.
5. When you stop for now, run `save`. It keeps this task's VM state and frees the VM. Save
   whenever you'll be away from the VM for a while, such as waiting on the user, so others can use it.
6. After this task's work has merged, run `end`. It deletes this task's checkpoints and puts its VM back to Clean.

`status` lists every VM, who holds it, whether that Claude session is still open, and when they
last used it.

## Running a repo's tests in the VM

- **If the repo marks its GUI tests** (a pytest marker, a separate folder or project), run only the
  windowless ones on the PC, for example `pytest -m "not gui"` or `pytest tests/unit`, and the GUI
  ones in the VM. Check the marker really covers every test that builds a window.
- **If it doesn't**, run the whole suite in the VM. Suggest to the user that the repo gets a marker.
- **Never run GUI tests in parallel** (`-n`) in the VM either: they take focus from each other.

The recipe (Python shown; the same shape works for .NET or Node):

1. `begin`. Then put the runtime in, as the normal user (no `-Elevated`), for example:
   `run "winget install --id Python.Python.3.13 -e --architecture x64 --scope user --silent --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements" -Timeout 900`
   x64 is the safe choice even in an Arm64 VM: more packages have x64 wheels, and Windows emulates them.
   Most native packages (wxPython, PyQt, numpy builds and so on) also need the Visual C++ runtime,
   which a clean Windows doesn't have. Without it, imports fail with "DLL load failed". It's
   per-machine, so: `run "winget install --id Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64 -e --silent --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements" -Elevated`2. Copy in the repo's committed files, not its local virtual environments or build output:
   - `git archive --format zip -o repo.zip HEAD` in the repo (uncommitted changes aren't included;
     commit first, or use `git stash create` to archive the working tree's tracked files);
   - `push repo.zip`;
   - `run "powershell -NoProfile -Command Expand-Archive C:\vmtest\files\repo.zip C:\vmtest\repo -Force"`.
3. Install the dependencies the way the repo's CI does: read its workflow files, put the steps in a
   `.cmd` and `run -ScriptFile setup.cmd -Timeout 2400`. Make a virtual environment in
   `C:\vmtest\repo`, and use the runtime's full path, since PATH may not have caught up yet.
4. Run the tests the way CI does, with `run` and a generous `-Timeout`. Test windows open and close
   on the VM's screen, where they belong.
5. `save` keeps the runtime and dependencies for this task's next `begin`. `end` throws them away.
   If many tasks need the same runtime, put it into Clean once (the README's "Keeping Clean up to date").

## Things that catch people out

- **Admin rights.** Programs run without admin rights by default, like a normal user's.
  - Add `-Elevated` for per-machine installs, or to drive a window of a program running as administrator.
  - vmtest refuses, and says so, when you'd need it.
- **`run` follows batch-file rules.** Write `%` as `%%`. Use `-ScriptFile file.ps1|.cmd` for long commands or tricky quoting.
- **`run` exit codes.** `run` exits with the command's own exit code. Anything a `run` starts may end along with it, so use `launch` for programs that should stay open.
- **Text or ids starting with `-`.** PowerShell reads them as parameter names. Pass text as `-Target "-5"`, and ids as `id:-31984` (wxPython gives most controls negative ids).
- **Menus.** Open one with keys (`keys "%f"`), then keep using `keys` to move and choose. `tree`, `windows` and every focus report show its items, with the highlighted one marked.
- **Dialogs.** `windows` shows a dialog under the window that owns it, and `-Window "<dialog title>"` finds it. `-Window <pid>` means the program's main window, and its tree includes its dialogs. While a modal dialog is up, keys aimed at its owner go to the dialog, as a person's would.
- **Something else in front.** If `keys` says it couldn't bring the window to the front, the message names what's in front instead (often a Windows notification). Deal with that the way a person would, for example `tree -Window "New notification"` and `invoke "No thanks"`, then try again.
- **Classic controls.** Win32 controls the .NET UI Automation client sees as blank panes get their role, name and value from MSAA, as in `Pane [MSAA role: editable text] 'Notes' value='...'`.
- **Windows 11 Notepad isn't a good typing target.** It can mangle fast keyboard input (lost Shift, repeated characters). Test typing in the app under test instead.
- **Keyboard checks.** To check keyboard access, use `keys "{TAB}"` and read where focus lands. `invoke` and `focus` act through the accessibility API, so they don't prove anything works from the keyboard.
- **Classic dialog buttons.** Some classic Win32 controls show as plain panes in UI Automation, so vmtest adds their MSAA role, as in `Pane [MSAA role: push button] 'No'`. `invoke` presses them.
- **What vmtest can't tell you.** It reports roles, names, states and focus, not speech. Tell the user which checks need a person with a screen reader, and what they should hear.
- **winget local manifests.** `winget install --manifest` may stop partway in the VM (TheWorkBench issue #142). Install the MSI directly instead.
- **If vmtest itself misbehaves:**
  - Report the exact command and output to the user. Don't edit vmtest from another project's session.
  - Don't work around it by testing on the user's PC.
