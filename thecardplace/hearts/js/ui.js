/* Hearts - the interface, and the voice.
 *
 * This game has to be playable with the screen turned off. That is not a
 * decoration on top of a visual game; it decides the shape of everything here.
 *
 * ---- the announcement queue ----
 *
 * There are exactly two live regions and one queue. Everything spoken goes
 * through say(), which serialises per region and leaves a gap between messages,
 * because a live region that is written twice inside a few milliseconds does not
 * read twice — it reads the second half of one sentence and the first half of
 * the next, and the player hears nonsense at the exact moment something
 * important happened.
 *
 * A REQUEST PREEMPTS A GAME EVENT, AND THE EVENT IS REQUEUED RATHER THAN
 * DROPPED. When somebody presses H for their hand while the computer is playing,
 * the hand should be read immediately — but the card that was about to be
 * announced still has to be announced, or the player is left with a trick that
 * silently changed. Dropping it is the easy implementation and the wrong one.
 *
 * ---- what is not a live region ----
 *
 * The log is not one, and neither is the status line. They carry the same words
 * the announcer speaks. Making either of them live would say everything twice
 * and reintroduce the race the queue exists to prevent.
 *
 * ---- no role="application" ----
 *
 * The whole page stays in ordinary browse mode. Every card is a button and every
 * shortcut is also a button on screen, so nothing is reachable only one way. A
 * game that seizes the keyboard takes away the reading controls the player
 * already knows in exchange for shortcuts they have to learn.

     *   1. Compare the phase. Right exactly once a hand: every trick after the
     *      first leaves the phase at 'play', so the turn came round twelve more
     *      times and focus never moved.
     *
     *   2. Compare whose turn it was last time. Right whenever the turn visibly
     *      leaves this seat and comes back — and WRONG IN THE ONE CASE THAT
     *      MATTERS MOST. When you play the fourth card of a trick and take it,
     *      the turn goes from you to you: finishTrick sets the leader to the
     *      winner in the same action, so there is no frame in between and no
     *      change to notice. Take a trick and the game sits there waiting on a
     *      hand you cannot reach. Exactly what was reported, twice.
     *
     *   3. Compare a token for the MOMENT. If any of these moved and it is now
     *      ours, the game is waiting on us and focus belongs where the cards
     *      are. If nothing moved, nothing is taken — somebody reading the log
     *      during their own turn is left alone.

     * I reverted version 3 once already, on the grounds that mutation testing
     * could not tell it from version 2. It could not because I never made it
