/* Hearts - the rules, and the only door into them.
 *
 * Four players, thirteen tricks, no trump. Every heart is worth a point and the
 * queen of spades is worth thirteen, and the object is to take none of them. The
 * game ends when somebody reaches a hundred; the LOWEST score wins, which is the
 * one thing about this game that surprises people who have only played the
 * others in this repository.
 *
 * ---- the four rules that are actually the game ----
 *
 * 1. THE TWO OF CLUBS LEADS THE FIRST TRICK. Not the dealer's left, not the
 *    winner of anything — whoever holds it, plays it. It is not a choice.
 *
 * 2. NOTHING SCORING ON THE FIRST TRICK. No heart, no queen of spades, unless a
 *    player has nothing else at all. A hand of thirteen hearts cannot follow this
 *    rule, so the rule has to yield rather than the deal being illegal.
 *
 * 3. HEARTS MUST BE BROKEN BEFORE THEY CAN BE LED. A heart may be discarded on a
 *    suit you cannot follow at any time, and that is what breaks them. Until
 *    then a player holding nothing but hearts may still lead one — again, the
 *    rule yields rather than trapping somebody with no legal move.
 *
 * 4. SHOOTING THE MOON. Take all twenty-six and everybody else takes
 *    twenty-six instead. This is the rule that makes the scoring worth testing
 *    twice: it inverts the sign of the whole hand, and an engine that adds up
 *    points correctly and forgets this is wrong in the most spectacular way
 *    available.
 *
 * ---- the passing ----
 *
 * Three cards, and the direction rotates: left, right, across, then a hand where
 * nobody passes at all. The hold hand is not decoration — a four-hand cycle with
 * no hold means the deal number and the direction stay in lockstep for ever, and
 * every fourth hand plays identically to every other fourth hand.
 *
 * Passing is simultaneous. Nobody may see what they were given before choosing
 * what to give, which means the engine holds four sets of three cards and swaps
 * them only when all four are in. view.js is what stops a passed card being
 * visible early, and it is tested separately, but the engine is what makes that
 * possible by never putting a passed card anywhere a projection would find it.
 *
 * ---- the contract this file has to meet ----
 *
 * createGame, applyAction, eventsFor, seatToAct, canDeal, note, vb — the shared
 * transport in ../shared/js/ drives an engine it knows nothing about through
 * exactly these, and shared/tests/engine-contract.js holds every game in this
 * repository to them. canDeal in particular must be EXACTLY the set of phases
 * applyAction accepts a nextHand in: too broad and the player gets a raw refusal
 * while somebody else is visibly dealing, too narrow and the deal is swallowed
 * in silence. Both of those have happened here.
 *
 * applyAction is the single authorization gate. Nothing else may move the game.
 * Not because doPlay is dangerous in itself, but because the seat check lives in
 * one place and a function that trusts its caller is a hole the size of the
 * whole table once there is a socket.
