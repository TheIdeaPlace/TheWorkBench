// The shape every game screen shares. A game supplies its session, the
// sections of its table, and the buttons its current phase offers; this file
// puts them where a VoiceOver player expects to find them.
//
// The layout, top to bottom, is the same in all five games:
//
//   status line, last announcement                          (scrolls)
//   the game's own sections: the trick, the play, the scores…
//   ---------------------------- pinned to the bottom edge ----------------
//   Your hand (heading)
//     the cards, in a space that stays the same size all hand long
//   Controls (heading)
//     the phase's choices, when it has any: Pass, Bid nil, Call hearts…
//     [primary action]                                    [Log] [Repeat]
//
// The hand and the controls are pinned, so they are where a finger expects
// them no matter what the table above is showing. The primary action — Cut,
// Throw, Next, Deal, Continue — is always the button in the lower left
// corner of the screen; the controls used in every game sit at the lower
// right; the hand is always directly above them, and keeps the height of a
// full hand as cards are played so the cards that remain do not drift.
// Nothing on the table tells the player what to do; the button says what it
// does, and the status line says where the game is.

/// One thing a player can press. The screen draws it; the session says what
/// it is called and what it does.
