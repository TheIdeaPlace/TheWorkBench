// Hearts - the rules, and the only door into them. A port of `hearts/js/game.js`.
//
// Four players, thirteen tricks, no trump. Every heart is worth a point and the
// queen of spades is worth thirteen, and the object is to take none of them. The
// game ends when somebody reaches the target; the LOWEST score wins.
//
// The four rules that are actually the game:
//
// 1. The two of clubs leads the first trick. Whoever holds it plays it.
// 2. Nothing scoring on the first trick, unless a player has nothing else.
// 3. Hearts must be broken before they can be led — unless a player holds
//    nothing but hearts. The rule yields rather than deadlocking.
// 4. Shooting the moon: take all twenty-six and everybody else takes
//    twenty-six instead.
//
// Passing is simultaneous: the engine holds four sets of three and swaps them
// only when all four are in.
