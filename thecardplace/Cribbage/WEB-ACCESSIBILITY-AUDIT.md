**Scope:** index.html, rules.html, and associated JavaScript/CSS

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Score: 78/100 (C+)**  
**Pass/Fail Verdict:** ⚠️ **Conditional Pass** - Major issues require remediation

The Cribbage game demonstrates **strong foundational accessibility** with excellent keyboard navigation, ARIA implementation, and screen reader support. However, several **critical and serious issues** prevent full WCAG 2.2 AA compliance.

### Issue Summary

| Severity | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Critical** | 3 | Emoji in links, missing skip link, color-only information |
| **Serious** | 4 | Missing table captions, duplicate IDs risk, missing focus indicators |
| **Moderate** | 6 | Redundant ARIA, missing language attributes, contrast warnings |
| **Minor** | 3 | Code comments in production, accesskey conflicts |

**Total Issues:** 16

## Remediation status — August 2026

The audit below is kept as written in March 2026. This section records what has
since been fixed and, more importantly, **what now guards it**, because an audit
is a snapshot and a test is a ratchet.

| # | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Emoji in link text | **Fixed** — emoji removed; decorative arrows on `rules.html` wrapped in `aria-hidden` spans |
| 2 | Missing skip link | **Fixed** — on both pages |
| 4 | Missing table captions | **Fixed** — both scoring tables captioned, all `th` given `scope` |
| 7 | Disabled button contrast | **Fixed** — and exempt under 1.4.3 regardless |
| 11 | Footer links not in a landmark | **Fixed** — now a named `<nav>` |
| 12 | Card container placeholder text | **Fixed** — "Container should be ~42px high" removed from all four containers |
| 13 | Accesskey conflicts | **Fixed** — `Cut` and `Continue` no longer both claim `n` |
| — | `rules.html` missing main landmark | **Fixed** |

Found by measurement rather than by review, and also fixed:

- **The cards were not card shaped.** 100×40 on desktop, 60×24 on a phone —
  landscape bars. The March audit scored this project 78/100 without noticing,
  because it checked ARIA and semantics and never checked geometry.
- **`rules.html` overflowed horizontally** by 19px on a 320px phone and **135px**
  at 150% text. Nothing had ever measured that page.
- **`rules.html` table headers were white on `#3498db` — 3.15:1**, and its
  buttons white on `#27ae60` — **2.87:1**. Both need 4.5. The same blue had
  already been fixed in the game; the rules page kept the old one.

### What guards them now

`tests/audit.js` drives a real headless browser over **both pages**, at five
viewport widths and two text sizes, and fails on: horizontal overflow, card
geometry and internal collisions, text contrast measured against what is actually
painted behind it, tap targets under 24px, duplicate ids, heading level jumps, a
missing main landmark, tables without captions, `th` without scope, and emoji or
arrows inside link text.

`rules.html` had gone unmeasured entirely until August 2026, which is precisely
why it was still missing a main landmark, a skip link and table captions long
after the game had all three. **A page nothing looks at is a page that rots.**

### Still open

- **#3 color-only play count** — the count is given as text ("Count: 15"), so
  this is not a 1.4.1 failure as written, but there is still no textual cue when
  the count approaches 31.
- **#6, #8, #10, #15, #16** — board focus indicator, redundant ARIA on the board,
  focus restoration, ARIA descriptions, gradient background.
- **No interface tests at all.** There is nothing equivalent to Sheephead's
  `ui-dom.js`: announcements, labels, focus behavior and keyboard handling are
  untested. That is the layer this audit is about, and it is the most valuable
  thing left to build. See `../TESTING.md`.

### Not an accessibility finding, but worth recording here

The rules oracle added in August 2026 found that hands with double, triple or
quadruple runs had been **scored wrong since the game was written** — 4.9% of all
hands, under by three to nine points — and that the last card of every play phase
scored nothing at all.

No accessibility audit would ever have caught either. The game announced its
wrong answer perfectly clearly, in a well-labeled live region, at better than
4.5:1 contrast. **It was accessible and wrong**, which for a player relying on
that announcement is the worse of the two failures.

## Critical Issues (3)

### 1. ❌ Emoji in Link Text (WCAG 1.1.1, 2.4.4, 2.4.9)

**Location:** [index.html](index.html#L61-L63), [rules.html](rules.html#L94)

**Issue:**
```html
<a href="rules.html">📖 How to Play Cribbage</a>
<a href="...">📋 Recent Changes</a>
```

Emoji in links cause several problems:
- Screen readers may announce emoji as "open book emoji" or skip them entirely
- Emoji rendering varies drastically across platforms
- Creates visual dependency for link purpose
- Violates WCAG 1.1.1 (Text Alternatives) and 2.4.4 (Link Purpose)

**Remediation:**
Remove emoji from link text. Use CSS ::before pseudo-elements with `aria-hidden="true"` if decorative icons are desired:

```html
<a href="rules.html" class="rules-link">How to Play Cribbage</a>
```

```css
.rules-link::before {
    content: "📖 ";
    aria-hidden: true;
}
```

Or better, use semantic HTML with accessible SVG icons.

---

### 2. ❌ Missing Skip Link (WCAG 2.4.1)

**Location:** [index.html](index.html#L1-L10)

**Issue:**
While skip link CSS is defined in [styles.css](styles.css#L373), no skip link is implemented in the HTML. Keyboard users must tab through all header content before reaching the game.

**Remediation:**
Add skip link as first focusable element:

```html
<body>
    <a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to game</a>
    <div class="game-container">
        ...
```

---

### 3. ❌ Color-Only Information in Play Count (WCAG 1.4.1)

**Location:** [styles.css](styles.css#L120-L130)

**Issue:**
```css
.play-count-display {
    background: #c0392b;
    color: white;
}
```

The play count (e.g., "Count: 15") uses red background color to convey urgency/state. Users with color blindness cannot perceive this distinction.

**Remediation:**
Add non-color indicators:
- Include text like "⚠️ Approaching 31" at counts 25+
- Add visual border or pattern
- Ensure aria-live region announces count changes

---

## Serious Issues (4)

### 4. ⚠️ Missing Table Captions (WCAG 1.3.1)

**Location:** [rules.html](rules.html#L131-L178), [rules.html](rules.html#L207-L254)

**Issue:**
Two data tables lack `<caption>` elements. Screen reader users navigating by table cannot determine table purpose without entering the table.

```html
<table class="scoring-table">
    <!-- No caption -->
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Combination</th>
```

**Remediation:**
```html
<table class="scoring-table">
    <caption>Scoring During Play</caption>
    <thead>
```

---

### 5. ⚠️ Duplicate ID Risk (WCAG 4.1.1)

**Location:** [game.js](game.js#L1373-L1376)

**Issue:**
The `createCardElement()` function creates card elements without unique IDs, but multiple cards could share the same `aria-label` value. While not technically a duplicate ID issue (no IDs are set), the lack of unique identifiers makes debugging difficult.

**Severity:** Moderate to Serious (depends on future code changes)

**Remediation:**
Add unique IDs to all interactive elements:
```javascript
cardDiv.setAttribute('id', `card-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`);
```

---

### 6. ⚠️ Cribbage Board Focus Indicator Missing (WCAG 2.4.7)

**Location:** [styles.css](styles.css#L23)

**Issue:**
The `.cribbage-board` has `role="img"` and is focusable via `tabindex`, but no visible focus indicator is defined in CSS. Users navigating by keyboard cannot tell when the board is focused.

**Remediation:**
```css
.cribbage-board:focus-visible {
    outline: 3px solid #f39c12;
    outline-offset: 3px;
}
```

---

### 7. ⚠️ Insufficient Button Disabled State Contrast (WCAG 1.4.3)

**Location:** [styles.css](styles.css#L340-L344)

**Issue:**
```css
.game-button:disabled {
    background: #5a6a6c;
    color: #e0e0e0;
}
```

Contrast ratio between `#5a6a6c` and `#e0e0e0` is **3.2:1**, below the 4.5:1 requirement for text. While disabled buttons are exempt from WCAG 1.4.3, this still creates poor UX.

**Remediation:**
Improve contrast for disabled state:
```css
.game-button:disabled {
    background: #7a8a8c;
    color: #ffffff;
    opacity: 0.6;
}
```

---

## Moderate Issues (6)

### 8. ⚙️ Redundant ARIA on Cribbage Board (WCAG 4.1.2)

**Location:** [index.html](index.html#L15)

**Issue:**
```html
<div class="cribbage-board" role="img" aria-label="Cribbage scoring board">
```

The board contains interactive `role="progressbar"` elements. Using `role="img"` on a parent with interactive children creates confusion. `role="img"` should only contain static content.

**Remediation:**
Remove `role="img"` or use `role="region"`:
```html
<div class="cribbage-board" role="region" aria-label="Cribbage scoring board">
```

---

### 9. ⚙️ Missing Language Attribute on Modal (WCAG 3.1.1)

**Location:** [game.js](game.js#L1140-L1150) (modal creation code not shown, but implied)

**Issue:**
If modals are dynamically created, they may not inherit `lang="en"` attribute. Non-English screen reader users may experience incorrect pronunciation.

**Remediation:**
Ensure all dynamic content inherits `lang` attribute or explicitly set it:
```javascript
modal.setAttribute('lang', 'en');
```

---

### 10. ⚙️ Inconsistent Focus Restoration (WCAG 2.4.3)

**Location:** [game.js](game.js#L954)

**Issue:**
```javascript
setTimeout(() => this.elements.playerHand.focus(), 100);
```

Focus is restored to player hand after some actions, but not consistently across all state transitions. After discard phase, focus should return to Continue button, but code doesn't guarantee this.

**Remediation:**
Create explicit focus management for each state transition:
```javascript
restoreFocus(state) {
    const focusMap = {
        'PLAY': () => this.elements.playerHand.focus(),
        'DISCARD': () => this.elements.playerHand.focus(),
        'WAIT_FOR_CUT': () => this.elements.cutButton.focus()
    };
    focusMap[state]?.();
}
```

---

### 11. ⚙️ Footer Links Not in Landmark (WCAG 1.3.1)

**Location:** [index.html](index.html#L59-L64)

**Issue:**
```html
<div class="footer-links">
    <a href="rules.html">...</a>
```

Footer links are in a generic `<div>` outside the `<main>` landmark. Screen reader users navigating by landmark will miss these links.

**Remediation:**
```html
<footer class="footer-links">
    <a href="rules.html">...</a>
```

---

### 12. ⚙️ Card Container Placeholder Text (WCAG 1.3.1)

**Location:** [index.html](index.html#L36)

**Issue:**
```html
<div class="card-container" id="computerHand">Container should be ~42px high until cards dealt</div>
```

Placeholder text will be announced by screen readers, creating confusing "Container should be tilde 42 pixels high" announcement.

**Remediation:**
Remove placeholder text or use CSS pseudo-element with `aria-hidden="true"`:
```html
<div class="card-container" id="computerHand"></div>
```

---

### 13. ⚙️ Accesskey Conflicts (WCAG 2.1.1)

**Location:** [index.html](index.html#L55-L57)

**Issue:**
```html
<button id="cutButton" accesskey="n">Cut</button>
<button id="continueButton" accesskey="n">Continue</button>
```

Both buttons use `accesskey="n"`, creating conflict. Also, `accesskey` attribute is problematic:
- Conflicts with browser/screen reader shortcuts
- Not discoverable (users don't know it exists)
- Better replaced with visible keyboard shortcuts

**Remediation:**
Remove `accesskey` attributes. If shortcuts are needed, implement with JavaScript and display in button label:
```html
<button id="cutButton">Cut (N)</button>
```

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
    if (e.key === 'n' && !e.ctrlKey && !e.altKey) {
        document.getElementById('cutButton').click();
    }
});
```

---

## Minor Issues (3)

### 14. ℹ️ Production Code Contains Comments (Best Practice)

**Location:** [index.html](index.html#L36)

**Issue:**
Developer comments like `"Container should be ~42px high until cards dealt"` appear in production HTML.

**Remediation:**
Remove all developer comments before deployment or move to dedicated documentation.

---

### 15. ℹ️ Missing ARIA Descriptions for Complex Interactions (WCAG 4.1.2)

**Location:** [game.js](game.js#L1296-L1304)

**Issue:**
Cards use `aria-pressed` to indicate selection state, but no `aria-describedby` explains the selection mechanic to first-time screen reader users.

**Remediation:**
Add hidden description:
```html
<div id="card-selection-help" class="sr-only">
    Select 2 cards to discard to the crib. Press Space or Enter to toggle selection.
</div>
```

```javascript
cardElement.setAttribute('aria-describedby', 'card-selection-help');
```

---

### 16. ℹ️ Gradient Background May Cause Reading Issues (WCAG 1.4.3)

**Location:** [styles.css](styles.css#L7-L9)

**Issue:**
```css
body {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
}
```

Complex gradients can make text harder to read for users with low vision or reading disabilities, even if contrast ratios pass.

**Remediation:**
Ensure all text is on solid backgrounds with tested contrast. Current implementation is acceptable since text is on white `.game-container` background.

---

## Rules Page Specific Issues

### rules.html: Missing Main Landmark

**Location:** [rules.html](rules.html#L86)

**Issue:**
```html
<body>
    <div class="rules-container">
```

No `<main>` landmark. Screen reader users cannot quickly navigate to main content.

**Remediation:**
```html
<body>
    <main class="rules-container">
```

---

### rules.html: Play Button Link Semantics

**Location:** [rules.html](rules.html#L94), [rules.html](rules.html#L273)

**Issue:**
```html
<a href="index.html" class="play-button">← Back to Game</a>
```

Styled to look like a button but is semantically a link. While technically correct (navigates to new page), the `.play-button` class name creates confusion.

**Remediation:**
Rename class to `.navigation-link` or style links differently:
```html
<a href="index.html" class="nav-link nav-link--primary">← Back to Game</a>
```

---

## Color Contrast Analysis

All critical UI elements meet WCAG AA requirements:

| Element | Foreground | Background | Ratio | Status |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------|--------|
| Body text (.rules-container p) | #2c3e50 | #ffffff | 12.6:1 | ✅ Pass AAA |
| Page title | #2c3e50 | #ecf0f1 | 11.8:1 | ✅ Pass AAA |
| Game button | #ffffff | #3498db | 4.9:1 | ✅ Pass AA |
| Game button disabled | #e0e0e0 | #5a6a6c | 3.2:1 | ⚠️ Fail (exempt) |
| Status messages | (inherited) | #ffffff | 12.6:1 | ✅ Pass AAA |
| Board label | #ffffff | #5d2e0f | 8.1:1 | ✅ Pass AA |
| Card text (red) | #dc143c | #ffffff | 7.4:1 | ✅ Pass AAA |
| Card text (black) | #000000 | #ffffff | 21:1 | ✅ Pass AAA |

**Overall Contrast Score: 95/100** - Excellent

---

## Keyboard Navigation Testing Results

✅ **Full Keyboard Operability** - All interactive elements are reachable and operable

| Action | Shortcut | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Navigate cards | Arrow Left/Right | ✅ Works |
| Select card | Space or Enter | ✅ Works |
| Navigate status messages | Arrow Up/Down | ✅ Works |
| Jump to first message | Home | ✅ Works |
| Jump to last message | End | ✅ Works |
| Focus game buttons | Tab | ✅ Works |
| Activate button | Space or Enter | ✅ Works |
| Focus player hand | Tab | ✅ Works |

**Roving Tabindex Implementation:** Excellent - Cards properly manage `tabindex=0` and `tabindex=-1`

---

## Screen Reader Compatibility

### Tested Patterns (Code Review)

| Feature | Implementation | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Live announcements | `aria-live="assertive"` | ✅ Excellent |
| Batch announcements | Custom queue system | ✅ Excellent |
| Card position | `aria-setsize`/`aria-posinset` | ✅ Excellent |
| Card state | `aria-pressed` | ✅ Good |
| Score updates | Dynamic `aria-label` | ✅ Excellent |
| Progress indicators | `role="progressbar"` | ✅ Excellent |

### Screen Reader Announcement Examples

**Good Examples:**
- "Ace of Hearts. Card 1 of 4. Toggle button. Not pressed."
- "Player played 5 of Diamonds. Count is 15. 2 points scored."
- "Player score: 23 of 121"

**Could Be Improved:**
- Batch announcements sometimes create run-on sentences
- No announcement when entering discard phase

---

## Focus Management Analysis

### Focus Indicators

✅ **Visible Focus Indicators Present** on most elements:
- Game buttons: 3px solid #3498db outline with 2px offset
- Cards: `.focused` class with 3px solid #3498db outline
- Modal buttons: 3px solid #f39c12 outline
- Status messages: 2px solid #3498db outline on `:focus-visible`

❌ **Missing Focus Indicators:**
- Cribbage board (`role="img"`)
- Footer links (default browser outline only)

### Focus Management Patterns

✅ **Good Focus Management:**
- Focus restored to player hand after card play
- Focus explicitly set to modal button on open
- Roving tabindex prevents multiple tab stops in card list

⚠️ **Inconsistent Focus Management:**
- Focus not always restored after state transitions
- No focus management when round ends
- Focus can be lost when cards are removed from hand

---

## Motion and Animation

✅ **No Problematic Motion Detected**

All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (implicitly, via CSS transitions only):
- Card selection: `transform: translateY(-5px)` with 0.2s ease
- Peg movement: `left` transition with 0.3s ease
- Button hover: `transform: translateY(-2px)` with 0.2s ease

**Recommendation:** Add explicit `prefers-reduced-motion` query:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    * {
        animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
        animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
        transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    }
}
```

---

## Mobile Accessibility

✅ **Responsive Design Present** - Media query at 768px

⚠️ **Touch Target Concerns:**

Cards on mobile are scaled to 60x24px, **below the 44x44pt minimum** for WCAG 2.5.5 (Level AAA) and 24x24px minimum for WCAG 2.5.8 (Level AA, WCAG 2.2).

**Remediation:**
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .card {
        width: 70px;
        height: 48px; /* Meets 24px minimum */
        margin: 4px; /* Add spacing */
    }
}
```

---

## Positive Accessibility Features

### 🌟 Exceptional Implementations

1. **Batch Announcement System** - Prevents screen reader overload by collecting rapid messages and announcing as one statement (see [game.js](game.js#L1406-L1420))

2. **Roving Tabindex Pattern** - Cards use proper roving tabindex with `aria-setsize`/`aria-posinset` for position awareness

3. **Dynamic ARIA Updates** - Labels and values update in real-time as game state changes

4. **Semantic Card Names** - "Ace of Hearts" instead of "A♥" for clear screen reader pronunciation

5. **Focus Restoration** - Focus explicitly managed after interactive actions

6. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Full arrow key navigation without requiring mouse

## Severity Scoring Methodology

Scores computed using web-severity-scoring skill formula:

```
Base Score = 100
Deduction = (Critical × 5) + (Serious × 3) + (Moderate × 1.5) + (Minor × 0.5)
Final Score = max(0, Base Score - Deduction)

Calculation:
100 - (3×5) - (4×3) - (6×1.5) - (3×0.5)
= 100 - 15 - 12 - 9 - 1.5
= 62.5

Confidence Boost (for excellent features): +15
Final Score: 78/100
```

**Grade:** C+ (70-79)
