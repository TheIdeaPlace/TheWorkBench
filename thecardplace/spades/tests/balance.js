/* Is this a game, or is it four bots agreeing with each other?
 *
 * The rules oracle proves the engine plays spades correctly. Correct and dull
 * are entirely compatible, and in this game they are only one bad constant
 * apart — the bidding is the whole tension, and the way to lose it is not a
 * crash but a drift.
 *
 * Two failure modes, both measured here, and both were actually produced while
 * tuning ai.js rather than imagined afterwards:
 *
 *   TOO TIMID. An early count came to eleven and a bit across a table where
 *   thirteen tricks exist. Every partnership made its contract, six per cent of
 *   hands were set, and the surplus tricks went into the bag bin — so the game
 *   was decided by sandbagging penalties rather than by bidding, and no hand
 *   ever had anything at stake.
 *
 *   TOO GREEDY. Correcting the count the other way took the table to thirteen
 *   and a bit. Thirteen bids against thirteen tricks means one side is set
 *   almost every hand by arithmetic rather than by play, a third of contracts
 *   went down, and games ran half again as long.
 *
 * The window between those is where spades lives, and the numbers below are the
 * measured middle of it. They are RANGES, wide enough not to fail on a seed
 * change and narrow enough to catch either drift. A change to ai.js that moves
 * one of them is not necessarily wrong — but it has to be looked at, which is
 * the entire job of this file.
