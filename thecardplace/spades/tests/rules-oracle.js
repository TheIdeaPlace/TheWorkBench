/* Does the engine play spades, or does it play something that looks like it?
 *
 * Every rule below is re-derived here by a DIFFERENT method from the one game.js
 * uses, and the two are compared after every single move of thousands of hands.
 * A test that re-implements the engine's own logic proves that the logic is
 * self-consistent, which it always is, and nothing else.
 *
 * Where game.js filters a hand, this counts. Where game.js tracks a flag, this
 * looks at what has actually been played. Where game.js decides a trick as it
 * goes, this replays the cards afterwards. The scoring in particular is checked
 * against a completely separate implementation in tests/scoring.js, driven by
 * worked examples rather than by play.
 *
 * THE TARGET, THE BAG LIMIT AND THE NIL VALUE ARE TAKEN FROM THE CONFIG THIS
 * SUITE BUILT THE GAME WITH, never from the engine's own constants. A suite that
 * asks the engine for the number and then checks the engine against it agrees
 * with any bug that reads the same wrong number twice — which is exactly how the
 * game next door shipped a "short game to fifty" that ran to a hundred.
