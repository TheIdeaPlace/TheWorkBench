/* Spades - the interface, and the voice.
 *
 * This game has to be playable with the screen turned off. That is not a
 * decoration on top of a visual game; it decides the shape of everything here.
 *
 * ---- the announcement queue ----
 *
 * There are exactly two live regions and one queue. Everything spoken goes
 * through say(), which serialises per region and leaves a gap between messages,
 * because a live region that is written twice inside a few milliseconds does not
 * read twice — it reads the second half of one sentence and the first half of
 * the next, and the player hears nonsense at the exact moment something
 * important happened.
 *
 * A REQUEST PREEMPTS A GAME EVENT, AND THE EVENT IS REQUEUED RATHER THAN
 * DROPPED. When somebody presses H for their hand while the computer is playing,
 * the hand should be read immediately — but the card that was about to be
 * announced still has to be announced, or the player is left with a trick that
 * silently changed.
 *
 * ---- what this game has to say that the others do not ----
 *
 * TWO NUMBERS, CONSTANTLY. How many tricks the partnership still needs, and how
 * many bags it is carrying. Neither is visible in the cards, both decide every
 * play, and a player who has to hold them in their head is playing a different
 * and much harder game than one who can ask. B reads the contract; the status
 * line carries it without being asked.
 *
 * A NIL IS AN EMERGENCY AND IS ANNOUNCED LIKE ONE. Assertive, the moment it goes
 * down, because it is a hundred points and it is otherwise invisible until the
 * hand is scored.
 *
 * ---- no role="application" ----
 *
 * The whole page stays in ordinary browse mode. Every card is a button and every
 * shortcut is also a button on screen, so nothing is reachable only one way. A
 * game that seizes the keyboard takes away the reading controls the player
 * already knows in exchange for shortcuts they have to learn.
