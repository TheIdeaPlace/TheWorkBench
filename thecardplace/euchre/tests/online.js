/* Playing over a wire, before there is a wire.
 *
 * js/localserver.js is an authoritative server that happens to run in the same
 * process: the real engine, the real authorization gate, the real projection,
 * and a faked network. Nothing here is a mock in the usual sense — what is
 * faked is the network, and only the network.
 *
 * Two things this harness has to get right, or it is an integration demo rather
 * than a test:
 *
 *   THE WIRE MUST BE ABLE TO MISBEHAVE. With a constant delay, setTimeout
 *   ordering makes the fake wire perfectly FIFO — and a FIFO, lossless,
 *   non-duplicating wire cannot produce the reordering that the version guard,
 *   the sequence correlation and the idempotency check all exist to survive. A
 *   test on such a wire proves those guards compile. Latency is jittered.
 *
 *   THE TABLE MUST BE BUSY. A guard that only misfires when an unrelated view
 *   arrives cannot misfire at a quiescent table, so the computer seats keep
 *   playing throughout.
 *
 * Nothing here writes to the authoritative state from outside the gate. Setting
 * truth.turn directly to reach an interesting case fabricates states the engine
 * cannot produce and quietly does the one thing the whole design forbids.
 *
