/* The only test that knows what euchre IS.
 *
 * Everything else in this directory checks that the game is consistent with
 * itself. That is a weaker property than it sounds. Swap two entries in a rank
 * table and the same cards still exist, so five tricks are still taken, the
 * score is still awarded to one side, the audit still balances, and the AI's
 * move is still validated against the very function that produced it. Every
 * self-consistency check passes while the wrong player wins every trick.
 *
 * So the rules here are written out BY HAND from the How to play Euchre dialog
 * in index.html, as literal data, and the engine is measured against them:
 *
 *   - the trump order for each of the four suits, as seven literal card ids
 *   - the non-trump order for each suit, with the left bower removed
 *   - the follow-suit rule, re-implemented from the sentence in the rules
 *   - the trick winner, re-implemented from "highest trump, else highest of the
 *     suit led"
 *   - the scoring table, as five literal rows
 *
 * THIS FILE MAY NOT CALL C.isTrump, C.power, C.beats, C.effSuit, C.sortHand,
 * G.legalPlays, G.trickWinnerIndex OR THE ENGINE'S SCORING. Those are the things
 * on trial. It builds its own answers and compares.
