/* Cribbage - card model.
 *
 * A whole 52-card deck, and no trump: cribbage is the odd one out among the
 * games in this repository in that no suit ever outranks another. Suits matter
 * in exactly two places — a flush, and one for his nob — and nowhere else.
 *
 * Two different numbers live on every card, and confusing them is the single
 * commonest cribbage bug:
 *
 *   value  what it counts for during the play and for fifteens. Ace is one, and
 *          the ten, jack, queen and king are ALL ten.
 *   order  where it sits in a run, and which card is lower when cutting for
 *          deal. Ace is one and the king is thirteen, so a ten is genuinely
 *          lower than a jack.
 *
 * The stable game in `Cribbage/` had this exact confusion in cutForDeal: it
 * compared by counting value, so a ten, jack, queen and king were all equal and
 * a tie came up 13% of the time instead of the 5.9% it should. The comment
 * beside the fix there is worth reading. Keeping the two as separately named
 * fields, rather than one function with a flag, is the cheapest way to stop it
 * happening again.
 *
 * Card ids are rank+suit, e.g. "AS", "TD". The ten is 'T' in an id and in the
 * rank field so that every id is two characters — "10S" would be three and
 * every substring assumption in the codebase would need a special case.
