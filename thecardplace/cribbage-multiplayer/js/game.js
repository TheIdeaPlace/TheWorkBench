/* Cribbage - rules engine. No DOM access lives in here.
 *
 * Two seats, 121 points, and a state machine driven by six actions: cut,
 * discard, play, go, next and nextHand.
 *
 * THREE THINGS THAT HAD TO CHANGE COMING FROM `Cribbage/`, and they are the
 * reason this is a fork rather than a copy.
 *
 * 1. THE COUNT RESET LIVED IN THE INTERFACE. In the stable game, reaching
 *    thirty-one or a mutual go leaves the engine in a PAUSE state and the
 *    BROWSER clears the pile — `handleContinue` does `game.playedPile = []`.
 *    That is invisible in a single tab and fatal on a server, which has no
 *    interface to do it: pairs and runs would go on scanning backwards across a
 *    reset, so a five played after a count reset would pair with a five from
 *    before it. Here the reset is the engine's, and the pile is never destroyed
 *    — `runStart` marks where the current sequence began, so the full play is
 *    still on record for the log and the audit while scoring only ever looks
 *    back as far as it should.
 *
 * 2. THE PAUSES ARE GONE. PAUSE_31 and PAUSE_GO existed so a player could read
 *    what had happened before the board changed under them. Online a pause is a
 *    synchronisation point: somebody has to press Continue, and if they do not
 *    the hand stalls for both. The announcement carries what the pause carried —
 *    "Thirty-one for two. The count goes back to nought" — and the speech queue
 *    already stops messages treading on each other.
 *
 * 3. THE DISCARD IS NOT SIMULTANEOUS ANY MORE, AND CANNOT BE. `discardToCrib`
 *    took the human's two cards and chose the computer's in the same call. Two
 *    people cannot be made to move in the same function call, so each seat sends
 *    its own discard and the hand waits until both are in. That wait is the only
 *    genuinely new state in the game: `discarded` holds what each seat has sent,
 *    `seatsOutstanding` says who is still being waited for, and the crib is not
 *    formed until nobody is.
 *
 * Counting is stepped rather than automatic, and each seat counts its own hand —
 * which is what happens at a real table, and gives the room a seat to hold
 * responsible if somebody walks away mid-count.

  /* ---------------- whose move ---------------- */

  /* Not simply `state.turn`. Two phases disagree with it: `idle` and
   * `roundOver`/`gameOver`, where nobody is on move and `turn` still holds
   * whatever it last held — read it there and the room schedules a computer
   * player to act on a hand that is over. */
  /* Could a deal be started right now?
   *
   * The room needs this and must not hardcode a phase name to get it. This file
   * was forked from a game whose finished-hand phase is called 'handOver', and
   * the room came with `state.phase !== 'handOver'` written into its nextHand
   * handling — which in cribbage is true at every single moment, so every deal
   * sent over the wire was quietly swallowed and answered with a re-sent view.
   * Online play could not get past hand one, and nothing said so.
   *
   * A predicate the engine owns cannot come apart from the engine that way. */
  /* May a hand be dealt right now?
   *
   * EXACTLY the phases applyAction accepts a nextHand in, and shared
   * contract tests hold all three games to that. The room asks this before
   * forwarding a Deal, and both ways of being approximately right are bugs:
   * too narrow and the deal is swallowed with no message at all, which is
   * what a copied handOver check did to cribbage; too broad and the player
   * gets the raw engine refusal — "the hand is not over" — while a new hand
   * is visibly being dealt in front of them, which is the exact confusion the
   * gate was added to prevent.
   *
   * idle belongs to the start action, not to this one. A table that has never
   * dealt is started by the people at it, deliberately. */
