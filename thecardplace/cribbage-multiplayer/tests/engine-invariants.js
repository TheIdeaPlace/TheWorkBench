/* Whole games, driven by the computer on both seats, checking the things that
 * must hold whatever the cards are.
 *
 * These are self-consistency checks — tests/rules-oracle.js exists because that
 * is a weaker property than it sounds. What this file adds is VOLUME and the
 * state machine: cribbage has more phases than the other games here, and the
 * transitions between them are where a hand gets stuck, a card gets played
 * twice, or somebody wins a game they should not have.
 *
 * THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST IS THE LAST ONE: the game ends the moment somebody
 * reaches the target, not at the end of the hand. A non-dealer who pegs out
 * during the play wins before the dealer ever counts, and getting that wrong
 * hands games to the wrong player in exactly the situations most worth winning.
