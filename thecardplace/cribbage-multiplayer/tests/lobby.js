 * tests/online.js proves the transport and the projection work. tests/room.js
 * proves the room survives eviction. Neither of them touches a single button —
 * so between them they would not notice if "Start a new table" did nothing, if
 * the table code never reached the screen, if the seat list marked the wrong row
 * as you, or if the game screen never appeared once the hand was dealt.
 *
 * Every one of those is a bug that makes multiplayer completely unusable while
 * every engine test stays green. This file clicks the buttons.
 *
 * The network is replaced with js/localserver.js — the real engine, the real
 * authorization gate, the real projection, and a faked wire. What is faked is
 * the network, and only the network.
