/* What a game has to provide before the shared transport can run it.
 *
 * shared/js/localserver.js and each game's room.js drive an engine they know
 * nothing about. That works because every engine exports the same handful of
 * functions and they mean the same thing in each. Nothing wrote that down, so
 * it was true by coincidence and stopped being true twice:
 *
 *   - sheephead had no seatToAct. Its copy of localserver.js had the rule
 *     written out inline instead, and that was the only reason localserver.js
 *     could not be shared. The same rule appeared four times in that game.
 *
 *   - sheephead had no canDeal. Its room.js tested `phase !== 'handOver'`
 *     directly, which is the exact line that was copied into cribbage — whose
 *     phase is called roundOver — and silently swallowed every deal that came
 *     over the wire. It was found by accident, in another game.
 *
 * This file is the contract, and it is checked against every game at once, so
 * that the next game is held to it before anybody plays on it rather than
 * after. Adding a game means adding one line to GAMES.
 *
 *   node shared/tests/engine-contract.js

  /* ---- the opening hand is drawn, not assigned --------------------------
   *
   * A person playing alone is put in one seat and left there, so any seat the
   * engine favours at the start of a game is a bias that same person carries
   * into every game they ever play. In spades that was seat 0: the first dealer
   * was hard-coded to it, the dealer bids last, and the lone player therefore
   * had the last word on the opening contract of every single game.
   *
   * Each game randomises this somewhere different — spades and euchre and
   * sheephead draw the first dealer, cribbage cuts for it, hearts has no dealer
   * at all and lets the two of clubs decide — so the contract cannot name a
   * mechanism. It names the OUTCOME the mechanisms exist to produce: who plays
   * the first card of a fresh game must not be the same seat every time.
   *
   * ONLY THE FIRST HAND COUNTS, and that is the whole subtlety here.
   *
   * A hand can be abandoned before a card is played — euchre throws one in when
   * all four pass twice, sheephead redeals when everybody passes — and both of
   * those advance the dealer on the way out. A walk that simply ran to the first
   * `play` it saw would happily record the opener of hand two, which rotates by
   * construction. That is a check that goes green on a first dealer nailed to
   * seat 0 as soon as misdeals are common enough, which is to say a check that
   * quietly stops testing the thing it was written for.
   *
   * So a walk that misdeals is discarded rather than counted. handsDealt below
   * is read off each engine rather than assumed, because the two names for it in
   * this repository are dealNumber and handNumber.
   *
   * Stops at the first pair of different answers, so a healthy game costs two
   * walks rather than forty. Forty is the ceiling before it is called fixed;
   * with four seats a fair draw survives that by a margin of about 10^-23. */
