/* The keyboard is the same keyboard in every game.
 *
 * Somebody who learns one of these games should not have to learn the keys
 * again for the next one. That was true by convention and by nothing else, so
 * it drifted: hearts shipped with five shortcuts against the other games'
 * eleven, and without N — the key that moves the game forward — at all.
 *
 * A convention nothing checks is a preference. This is the check.
 *
 * ---- what is actually required ----
 *
 * N, and the review keys the games share. NOT every key every game has: euchre
 * has O for play order because euchre has a play order, and demanding it of
 * cribbage would be demanding a game answer a question it does not have. The
 * shared set is the set a player carries between games.
 *
 * Three properties, and the second is the one that rots:
 *
 *   1. The key exists and is advertised — aria-keyshortcuts on a real control,
 *      so a screen reader can list it and a sighted player can see it.
 *   2. The key DOES something. A handler that reads a marker nothing sets is a
 *      shortcut that silently does nothing, and it looks fine in every review.
 *   3. No two controls claim the same key, because one of them silently loses.

   * key that does it takes the skill away from the person pressing it while the
   * player opposite is still counting in their head, which makes it worse than
   * useless: it is an uneven game dressed as help.
   *
   * So: a review key may report what has happened. It may not report what has
