/* Getting a card game onto a screen, without knowing which game it is.
 *
 * The audits in this directory measure a rendered page. Each game says how to
 * start itself in its own tests/drive.js. This file is what turns that into
 * something to run, and it exists because the answer was very nearly the same
 * every time: set the pace, maybe set the number of players, maybe set the skin,
 * submit the form.
 *
 * So the shared side owns all of that, and drive.js is left with only what is
 * genuinely particular to the game — a default table size, and any extra step
 * needed before there are cards to look at. Cribbage needs a cut. Nothing else
 * does.
 *
 * ---- the contract ----
 *
 *   name        what to call the game in a report
 *   defaults    optional, e.g. { players: 5 }
 *   afterStart  optional snippet run after the form is submitted
 *   playIn      snippet: play until the hand is over
 *
 * Snippets are strings, because they run inside the page rather than in node.
 *
 * NO BACKSLASHES IN THEM. They are written as template literals, and a backslash
 * in one is consumed when the literal is evaluated rather than when it is read,
 * so a character class arrives in the browser with its escape missing: it
 * compiles, it runs, and it matches nothing. A drive script that quietly matches
 * nothing does not fail, it just stops doing its job.

/* Run a drive snippet over and over until it says it is done.

 * runs out of things to click, and stops — long before the hand is over. That is
 * not hypothetical. Cribbage's hand-over scene was mid-play for a while, and
 * before that it was still sitting in the discard, and both times the audit
 * measured a real page with real cards on it and reported success. It was
 * looking at the wrong moment, not at nothing, which is much harder to notice.
 *
 * So the snippets return true when finished and this pumps them. Returns whether
 * it actually finished, and the caller is expected to care: an audit that says
 * "hand over" about a hand still being played is telling you something false.
