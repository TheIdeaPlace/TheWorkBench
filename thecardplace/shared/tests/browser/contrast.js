/* Text contrast audit — for any game in this repository.
 *
 * Walks every text-bearing element in a real browser, resolves the colour that
 * is actually rendered against whatever is actually painted behind it, and
 * reports anything under the WCAG AA threshold for its size. Muted grey on
 * near-black is easy to introduce by eye and hard to notice until somebody with
 * low vision tries it.
 *
 * This used to live inside sheephead-multiplayer, where it was the only copy —
 * the other two games had no contrast audit at all, so nobody had ever measured
 * them. Nothing in it was ever sheephead-specific except how to start a hand,
 * and that now comes from the game's own tests/drive.js.
 *
 *   node shared/tests/browser/contrast.js <game-directory>
 *
 * Not part of any `npm test`: it launches a browser, and on a machine where
 * somebody is listening to a screen reader that CPU spike is audible.
