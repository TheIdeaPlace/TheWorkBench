/* A room, with nothing platform-specific in it.
 *
 * This is the game server's logic. It does not know what a Durable Object is, or
 * a WebSocket, or setTimeout. Everything that touches the outside world is passed
 * in: storage, a clock, an alarm scheduler, and a way to send a message to a
 * connection. That is not architecture for its own sake — it is what makes the
 * whole thing testable in plain Node, including the part that cannot be tested
 * any other way.
 *
 * THE PART THAT CANNOT BE TESTED ANY OTHER WAY is eviction. A Durable Object is
 * evicted and woken constantly, and three of the things it holds produce a WRONG
 * GAME rather than an obvious failure if they do not survive:
 *
 *   version   resets to 0, so every client — holding versions in the hundreds —
 *             silently discards every view that follows as stale. The board
 *             freezes. No error, no timeout, views arriving and being dropped.
 *   cursors   reset, so the entire game's event log is replayed to every seat and
 *             a screen reader recites the whole hand again.
 *   lastSeq   resets, so a frame retried after a reconnect plays a second card.
 *
 * None of those is visible in a process that never evicts. So `hibernate()` and
 * `wake()` are first-class operations here, and tests/room.js drives a real hand
 * across several of them.
 *
 * Everything that decides the GAME still lives in game.js and view.js: this file
 * owns delivery, seating and persistence, and never rules on the rules.
