/* An authoritative server that happens to be in this tab.
 *
 * Same contract as the Durable Object that will replace it: it owns the only
 * real state, it decides what each seat may see, it refuses moves from seats
 * that are not entitled to make them, and it answers asynchronously after a
 * delay. Nothing here is a mock in the usual sense — the rules engine, the
 * authorization gate and the projection are the real ones. What is faked is the
 * network, and only the network.
 *
 * This exists for three reasons, in order of how much they matter:
 *
 *   1. The asynchronous client code has to be testable before the real server
 *      exists. Otherwise "the card does not move until the server says so" gets
 *      written blind, discovered broken during the first two-player test, and
 *      debugged across two machines and a websocket.
 *
 *   2. It proves the projection is sufficient. If a browser can play a complete
 *      hand from views alone, the views carry everything the interface needs. A
 *      field missing from js/view.js fails here, on a machine with a debugger,
 *      rather than online six weeks later.
 *
 *   3. THE SEAT COMES FROM THE CONNECTION, NEVER FROM THE MESSAGE. That is the
 *      property the whole authorization layer rests on, and it is a property of
 *      the server rather than of applyAction — one careless line reading
 *      msg.seat would reinstate the hole with the gate fully in place. Writing
 *      it here, now, means the Durable Object has a shape to copy instead of a
 *      decision to make.
