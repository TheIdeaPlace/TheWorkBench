 * The authoritative state holds every hand. This turns it into the much smaller
 * thing one seat is entitled to see. Everything the server sends a client goes
 * through here; nothing else may reach a socket.
 *
 * Built as an ALLOWLIST, and that choice is the whole design. A deny-list — copy
 * the state, delete the secrets — reads more naturally and fails silently the
 * first time somebody adds a field to createGame and forgets this file. It fails
 * in the direction of leaking, quietly, in code nobody is looking at. An
 * allowlist fails in the direction of a missing field, which shows up instantly
 * as a broken screen and gets fixed the same afternoon.
 *
 * The cost is that this file has to be revisited whenever state gains a field.
 * tests/projection.js enforces exactly that: it fails if a top-level key of
 * state has never been given a ruling here.
