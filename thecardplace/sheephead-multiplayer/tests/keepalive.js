/* The keepalive, and what a frozen tab does to it.
 *
 * js/net.js had no test of any kind — no test file loaded it at all — which is
 * the real finding here. What went wrong at a live table was that a seat's
 * socket closed, the player was told once into a region that then held nothing,
 * and the board went on showing a hand that had stopped being true. The close
 * came back with no reason code, so WHO hung up is not established: it may have
 * been the platform, the network, or the browser. It is written up here as the
 * open question it is rather than as a diagnosis.
 *
 * What IS established is that this file could not answer the question, because
 * nothing exercised it — and that writing these tests immediately turned up a
 * real ordering bug: the pong deadline was armed after the send, so an answer
 * that arrived during send() cancelled the previous ping's timer and left the
 * fresh one with nothing to cancel it. That would hang up on a socket which had
 * just that moment answered.
 *
 * The mechanism is a browser one, so it needs saying plainly. net.js pings every
 * twenty-five seconds and gives the pong ten seconds to arrive. Chrome throttles
 * timers in a backgrounded tab to roughly once a minute and freezes them
 * outright after a few minutes, so that ten second deadline fires having
 * actually waited a minute or more — and the pong it was waiting for may have
 * been sitting unprocessed the whole time. Nothing about the CONNECTION has been
 * demonstrated; the only thing proved is that the tab was asleep.
 *
 * So the rule under test: a deadline that fires far later than it was set for
 * was frozen, not ignored, and must not be read as evidence the wire is dead.
