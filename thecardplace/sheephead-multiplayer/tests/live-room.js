/* Real clients, real sockets, a real deployed room.
 *
 * Everything else in this directory tests against an in-process server with a
 * simulated network. That found a great deal and could not, even in principle,
 * find the class of bug that actually reached the player: the Worker delivering
 * nothing because a socket attachment was written too early, a client pointing at
 * a host that does not resolve, a table that starts playing before anybody can
 * share its code. Those live in the join between the pieces, and the join is what
 * a fake wire replaces.
 *
 * So this drives the DEPLOYED Worker over real WebSockets, with as many clients
 * as asked for, and prints a transcript of every frame. It is meant to be read as
 * much as asserted on: when something is wrong at a real table, the first
 * question is "what actually happened", and this answers it in one run instead of
 * two people comparing notes over the phone.
 *
 *   node tests/live-room.js                      # against the deployed Worker
 *   node tests/live-room.js --base http://127.0.0.1:8787   # against wrangler dev
 *   node tests/live-room.js --players 3 --hands 2 --quiet
 *
 * Exits non-zero if the table fails to behave, so it can be a CI job.
