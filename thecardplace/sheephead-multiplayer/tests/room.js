/* A room that keeps being evicted.
 *
 * A Durable Object is not a server that stays up. It is woken to handle a
 * message, and evicted again whenever the platform feels like it — mid-hand, mid
 * trick, between a player's move and the answer. Anything held in memory and not
 * in storage is gone, and three of the things this room holds produce a WRONG
 * GAME rather than an obvious failure when they vanish:
 *
 *   version   resets to 0. Clients are holding versions in the hundreds, so they
 *             discard every view that follows as stale. The board freezes. No
 *             error, no timeout — views keep arriving and are dropped in silence.
 *   cursors   reset. The whole game's event log is replayed to every seat, so a
 *             screen reader recites the entire hand again.
 *   lastSeq   resets. A frame retried after a reconnect plays a second card.
 *
 * None of that is visible in a process that never evicts, which is every test
 * written so far. So this file evicts constantly: between every single message,
 * in the fiercest run, and asserts a whole hand still comes out right.
