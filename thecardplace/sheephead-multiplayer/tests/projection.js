/* What one seat is allowed to see.
 *
 * This is the test the multiplayer build exists or fails on. Everything else can
 * be fixed in a patch release; a projection leak means people have been playing
 * a game where the cards were visible to anyone who opened developer tools, and
 * no apology puts that back.
 *
 * Three things are checked, and the third is the one that catches real bugs:
 *
 *   1. Entitlement — no card id appears in a seat's view unless that seat is
 *      entitled to know it.
 *   2. Completeness — every top-level key of `state` has been given an explicit
 *      ruling. The projection is an allowlist, and the failure mode of an
 *      allowlist is that somebody adds a field to createGame and never thinks
 *      about this file. So the ruling list lives here and the test fails on any
 *      key it has not seen.
 *   3. Indistinguishability — two games differing ONLY in hidden information
 *      must produce byte-identical views for a seat that is not entitled to that
 *      information. This is what catches leaks through absence: `partner: -1`
 *      versus the key being missing, `buried: []` versus undefined, an array
 *      length, a key order. Checking "the secret is not present" cannot catch
 *      any of those; checking "the two are the same string" catches all of them.
 *
 * The counterfactuals are CONSTRUCTED, not sampled. You cannot hold a deal fixed
 * while moving the Jack of Diamonds by dealing twice and hoping. The seed is
 * reset so both games get the same deal, and then one of them has the Jack moved
 * between two seats that are neither the viewer nor the picker.

 * The previous version of this section varied exactly one fact — the Jack of

 * the picker being able to tell the difference. Both were wrong, and each hid the
 * other:
 *
 *   - Moving the Jack between two BYSTANDERS never changes `alone`. So `alone`
 *     had no counterfactual at all, and broadcasting it to the whole table passed
 *     the entire suite.
 *   - The only thing that let the picker distinguish the twins was `view.partner`
 *     — which the picker is not entitled to. The anti-vacuity check was anchored
 *     on a leak, so fixing the leak broke the test. That is the shape of a test
 *     written to agree with the code rather than with the rules.
 *
 * So: several families, each varying a different secret, and the anchor moved to
 * the one partnership fact the picker legitimately holds — whether they are
 * alone.
 *
 * Everything is compared at the moment just after the bury. That is where the
 * most hidden information exists and where no behaviour has diverged yet; once
 * play starts the twins legitimately diverge, because a bot that knows a
 * different partner correctly plays differently, and comparing past that point
