/* Does a real Worker leave a thinking player alone?
 *
 * The turn clock takes a seat over when it stops responding, and it could not
 * tell that apart from a player who was reading their hand back — so it took
 * present players' cards off them, and the seat never came back. The fix leans
 * on the KEEPALIVE: the client pings every twenty-five seconds, the Worker
 * stamps the socket's attachment, and the room reads that stamp when it next
 * wakes.
 *
 * Every part of that lives on the platform. The attachment, hibernation, and the
 * fact that a ping is answered without waking the room at all are exactly what
 * tests/room.js has to fake, and faking them is how the seat-attachment bug
 * shipped. So this sits at a real table, over a real socket, and waits.
 *
 * It is slow on purpose — the wait is the Worker's own presence window plus its
 * turn grace, and cannot be hurried from out here.
 *
 *   node tests/live-presence.js --base http://127.0.0.1:8787
 *   node tests/live-presence.js                       # the deployed Worker
 *   node tests/live-presence.js --skip-silent         # only the fast half

/* HOW LONG A TAKEOVER MAY HONESTLY TAKE, DERIVED RATHER THAN WRITTEN DOWN.
 *
 * This said ninety seconds, which is turnGrace and is not the answer. Presence
 * is POLLED, once per grace period, so a check landing just inside the presence
 * window re-arms for another whole one — the real worst case is
 * `presenceWindow + turnGrace`, which is 270 seconds with the shipped numbers
 * and not 90. The Worker's own comment says exactly this, a few lines above the
 * constants; the test was written from the wrong one of the two.
 *
 * So it went red against a Worker that was behaving correctly, which is the
 * worst way for a test to fail: the thing under test was fine, the deadline was
 * wrong, and the only way to find that out was to read the server.
 *
 * Read out of the Worker rather than copied, so it moves when the numbers move.
 * Refuses to guess if it cannot find them — a default here is how the ninety
 * got in. */
