/* The connection, as the player experiences it during a game.
 *
 * What happened at a live table: a seat's socket closed, and the player was told
 * exactly once — into a live region that then held nothing — while the board
 * went on drawing a hand that had stopped being true. There was no standing
 * indication anywhere and no way back short of reloading and retyping a code
 * that was no longer on screen.
 *
 * The cause was structural rather than subtle. Connection state was written only
 * to the lobby's status line, and the lobby is hidden the moment the first hand
 * is dealt. ui.js even said the seat list carried the standing version "for
 * anyone who wants to check" — and the seat list is in the lobby too. So during
 * play there was no standing version of anything.
 *
 * js/net.js opens by saying that silence is the failure a screen reader user
 * cannot diagnose. This is that guarantee, asserted at the level the player
 * meets it.
 *
 * Requires jsdom:  npm install --no-save jsdom
