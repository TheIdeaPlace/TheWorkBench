/* Playing over a wire, before there is a wire.
 *
 * js/localserver.js is an authoritative server that happens to run in the same
 * process: the real engine, the real authorization gate, the real projection,
 * and a faked network. Nothing here is a mock in the usual sense — what is faked
 * is the network, and only the network.
 *
 * The first version of this file was a good integration harness and a weak
 * adversary, and a review said so with receipts. Two lessons are baked in here:
 *
 *   THE WIRE MUST BE ABLE TO MISBEHAVE. With a constant delay, setTimeout
 *   ordering makes the fake wire perfectly FIFO, and a FIFO lossless wire cannot
 *   produce the reordering that the version guard, the sequence correlation and
 *   the idempotency check exist to survive. Latency is jittered.
 *
 *   THE TABLE MUST BE BUSY. The pending-move case originally ran with the bots
 *   disabled and the turn pinned, which is the one configuration where no
 *   unrelated view can arrive — and an unrelated view was exactly what broke the
 *   double-send guard. Confirmed at the time: one keypress, two action frames on
 *   the wire. The guard now correlates on the sequence number the server echoes,
 *   and this file keeps the bots running while it checks.
 *
 * Nothing here writes to the authoritative state from outside the gate. The
 * earlier version set truth.turn and truth.phase directly to reach the case it
 * wanted, which fabricates states the engine cannot produce and quietly does the
 * one thing the whole design forbids.
