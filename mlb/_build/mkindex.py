<h1>Ballpark seating guides: where every section actually is</h1>

<div class="lede">
  <p>In order to assist in finding tickets for baseball games, these are overviews of each stadium,
  its sections, and details about the location of every section in the stadium.</p>
</div>

<p class="prose">A ticketing seat map answers one question at a glance: <em>where would I actually
be sitting?</em> These guides answer the same question in words. For every section in every park
covered here you get the level, where the section sits relative to home plate, how many rows deep it
is, which row the entrance is on, and which end of the row seat 1 is on.</p>

<p class="prose">{TOTAL} sections across {len(PARKS)} ballparks are documented so far, covering the whole of
the American League East, Central and West, and the National League East, Central and West.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why a section number on its own is not enough</h2>

<p class="prose">You might reasonably assume the conventions are the same everywhere. They are not.
Across the thirty parks here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Section numbers run in different directions.</strong> At seven parks they climb toward
  first base and right field, and at nineteen they climb the other way. At three more &mdash; Dodger
  Stadium, Petco Park and Tropicana Field &mdash; they do not sweep round the bowl at all: they run
  outward from home plate, odd numbers down one line and even numbers down the other. Fenway Park
  does both at once, sweeping on its lower tiers and numbering by parity on the Pavilion tiers.</li>
  <li><strong>Seat 1 is not on the same side.</strong> Facing the field it is on your left at eight
  parks and your right at nineteen. At Dodger Stadium and Petco Park it changes with the parity of
  the section, because seat 1 is the end of the row nearest home plate on both halves of the
  ballpark. At Sutter Health Park no source states it at all, and at Citi Field two sources state
  opposite rules.</li>
  <li><strong>Rows are numbers at some parks and letters at others.</strong> Angel Stadium, PNC Park,
  Great American Ball Park, Progressive Field, Kauffman Stadium, Nationals Park, Dodger Stadium and
  Tropicana Field use letters, running past Z into AA and beyond. Busch Stadium, Sutter Health Park,
  Comerica Park, Citi Field, loanDepot park, Oracle Park, Chase Field, Coors Field and Fenway Park
  use both at once. At most of those the lettered rows sit in front of the numbered ones; at Coors
  Field the numbers come first and a lettered block C to W sits behind them.</li>
  <li><strong>Even the dugouts move.</strong> The home dugout is on the first-base side at most of
  these parks, and the third-base side at Wrigley Field, PNC Park, Sutter Health Park, Rate Field,
  Progressive Field, Comerica Park, Oracle Park, Chase Field, Dodger Stadium and Rogers Centre. At
  loanDepot park and Yankee Stadium the sources contradict each other outright.</li>
  <li><strong>Accessible rows are labelled differently everywhere.</strong> WCH at Rate Field and
  again at Tropicana Field, VWC or WWC at Kauffman, an AC suffix at Comerica, WCA at Rogers Centre, a
  C or W suffix at Chase Field, WC interleaved mid-numbering at Target Field, a WC suffix on the last
  row at Citizens Bank Park, and at Nationals Park a WC suffix on the section number rather than the
  row. Oracle Park, Petco Park, Dodger Stadium and Fenway Park publish no convention at all, and at
  Oriole Park at Camden Yards there is no label either &mdash; section 336 reads 1&ndash;5,
  9&ndash;25 and the missing rows 6 to 8 are the wheelchair platform.</li>
  <li><strong>Numbering is not always continuous.</strong> Globe Life Field's lower level runs
  1&ndash;26 round the infield and then jumps to left field for 27&ndash;33. Target Field's Main
  Level wraps the whole way round, putting 132&ndash;140 back in right field, and Truist Park's,
  loanDepot park's and Oracle Park's lower levels do the same. American Family Field's Terrace rows
  skip 4, 6 and 7 entirely, and Nationals Park has no sections 410&ndash;415 because the press box
  sits there. At Oriole Park at Camden Yards one run of numbers, 1&ndash;98, alternates between two
  tiers, the even sections in front and the odd sections directly behind them.</li>
</ul>

<p class="prose">So a habit learned at one ballpark will mislead you at the next one. Each guide
below states the rule for that park and then applies it section by section, so you do not have to
work it out from the number alone.</p>

<h2 id="parks">The ballparks</h2>
<p class="prose">Grouped by division. Each links to a full guide.</p>
{cards}

<h2 id="method">How these were built</h2>

<p class="prose">Rows, entrance rows, ticket zones and seat-numbering direction come from
RateYourSeats, one page fetched per section, with A View From My Seat as a fallback. Orientation,
dugouts, bullpens, capacity and accessibility come from each team's own ballpark and accessibility
guides, cross-checked against independent ballpark guides.</p>

<p class="prose">Where a source does not state something, the data says so rather than guessing.
Every section carries a confidence rating, and every guide lists what could not be confirmed. The
underlying CSV and notes files are linked for download from each ballpark's page, so you can check
the working or reuse the data.</p>

<p class="prose">These pages are built to WCAG 2.2 Level AA and audited with axe-core in both light
and dark mode. No JavaScript is required to read any of the content.</p>

<h2 id="caveats">Before you buy</h2>

<p class="prose">Ballparks change. Netting gets extended, sections get renamed, construction blocks
sightlines that were fine last season. Everything here was compiled in August 2026 from public
sources and is not a substitute for the team's own ticket office, which can confirm a specific seat
and is the right place to arrange accessible seating.</p>

<p class="prose">If something here is wrong &mdash; a section placed on the wrong side of the park, a
row range that does not match the ticket in your hand, a seat-numbering rule that reads backwards
&mdash; please <a href="https://github.com/TheIdeaPlace/TheWorkBench/issues">file an issue on
GitHub</a>. Corrections from people who know a ballpark first-hand are the fastest way this gets
better, and the underlying data files linked from every ballpark page are there so you can check the
working.</p>
