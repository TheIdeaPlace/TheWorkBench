# The WorkBench

## Overview
The Workbench has small projects I’m working on. These may or may not be final or receive future development.
## Projects

### The Card Place
A landing page for the browser card games — pick a game and play. All of them are built to be
fully playable with a keyboard or a screen reader.

Every game, the landing page and the transport they share live under [`thecardplace/`][11]. They
were spread across the top level of this repository until they were not; the sections below name
them one at a time because they are separate games, but the directory is the unit that moves.

[Open The Card Place][5]

How the games are tested — what is covered, what is not, and what each suite exists because of —
is written up in [TESTING.md][7].

#### The Card Place for iOS

The same five games as a native SwiftUI app, played against the computer and entirely offline —
not a wrapper around the web pages. The rules and computer players are ported into a Swift
package with the same rules-oracle, invariant and hidden-information suites the browser games
have, and the screens are built for VoiceOver first: every card is a button that says what it is
and where it sits, every message goes through one announcement queue, and every part of a table is
a heading. It lives in [`thecardplace/ios/`](./thecardplace/ios/), and its README says how it is
built and how it meets WCAG.

### Euchre
Euchre for four, in two fixed partnerships, first to ten points. Play against three computer
opponents or open a table and play with other people; any empty seat is played by the computer, so
a table works with two people or four.

The interesting accessibility problem here is the left bower — the jack of the same colour as
trump, which becomes a trump card and stops being a card of its printed suit. A sighted player
absorbs that at a glance. So the game names both bowers wherever a card is read out, and while you
are bidding it tells you what your hand would be worth with the suit on offer as trump.

### Hearts
Hearts for four. Every heart is a point and the queen of spades is thirteen, and the lowest score
wins — which is the thing that catches new players out, so the game says it rather than assuming it.

[View Project][12]

### Spades
Spades for four in two fixed partnerships, with a bid made before a card is played. Missing the
contract costs the whole bid rather than the difference, and tricks taken over it fill a bag bin
that eventually costs a hundred — so the running bag count is text the same as everything else.

### Cribbage
Cribbage for two: pegging, fifteens, runs and the crib, scored to 121 on a board that reads as well
as it looks. Play the computer or open a table and play somebody else.

[View Project][10]

### Sheephead
The Wisconsin classic, also called Schafkopf, for three to six. Queens and jacks are trump, the
picker takes the blind, and the jack of diamonds is a secret partner nobody admits to. Any seat
nobody is sitting in is played by the computer, so a table works alone or with five other people.

How it was built — four review passes, and every place a reviewer contradicted the plan — is in
[PLAN.md](./thecardplace/sheephead-multiplayer/PLAN.md).

### The two originals: `Cribbage/` and `sheephead/`

Cribbage and Sheephead each began as a single-player game against the computer, and each was then
forked rather than rewritten, so that the working game could not regress while the networked one was
built. A CI guard still enforces that: a branch touching a fork and its original together fails.

The forks are the games now — they play the same alone, and other people can join — so The Card
Place links those, and these two are kept for reference rather than for playing. Each says so at the
top of its own page and asks search engines not to index it, because a page that does not say so is
indistinguishable from the live game.

## Other projects

### parallels-manager
A Mac app for managing Parallels Desktop virtual machines with VoiceOver and the keyboard, and
making new Windows 11 and Ubuntu VMs with no installer questions. **Moved to its own repository,
[TheIdeaPlace/ParallelsManager][1].**

### win11arm-install
Windows 11 ARM installation scripts and resources.

[View Project][2]

### hyperv-manage
A Windows application for managing Hyper-V virtual machines, built screen reader first: start,
stop, connect with Remote Desktop, settings, checkpoints, cloning, and building new Windows VMs.
The Windows counterpart of Parallels Manager. **Moved to its own repository,
[TheIdeaPlace/HyperVManage][14].**

### hyperv-rdp-vm
One PowerShell script that builds a Hyper-V Windows VM with an unattended install, ready to sign
in to with Remote Desktop from any computer on your network. **Moved, with Hyper-V Manage, to
[TheIdeaPlace/HyperVManage][15].**

### vmtest
Lets Claude test Windows apps inside a Hyper-V VM instead of on your own PC, so your focus,
keyboard and screen reader are never disturbed. It launches apps, reads their accessibility tree,
sends keys, takes screenshots and runs installers in the VM, with a checkpoint for each task. It
includes a Claude skill so every session knows to use it.

[View Project][16]

### quickcalc
An experimental calculator for Windows, built for JAWS, NVDA and Narrator users first. You type a
whole calculation and press Enter, and the answer is spoken straight away without moving focus.
Errors say what is wrong and where, the keypad is one Tab stop you move around with the arrow
keys, and a history list keeps every calculation to read back or reuse. Its UI tests drive the
real app through UI Automation, the same interface screen readers use.

[View Project][17]

### audio-demo
Makes an audio demo of a Windows app: two AI hosts talk it through, with real screen reader
recordings of the app in use in between, as one MP3. The hosts are Kokoro, a free neural voice
engine that runs on your own PC. The recordings are Windows Narrator in a vmtest VM, captured
through a virtual audio cable. It includes a Claude skill, an installer, and the tools to record,
check and assemble a demo. The first one was a 25-minute tour of QuickMail.
